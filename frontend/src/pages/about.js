            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>I am currently studying Computer Science, and will graduate with a B.S in May 2026.
                I have proficiency programming in C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and have practiced my skills
                both solo and on an agile scrum team. I am currently looking to obtain work experience in the tech
                field by seeking internships, and gaining knowledge through personal projects.
            </div>
            <div>
                When I am not coding, I enjoy dancing ballet, traveling, and baking cookies and other baked goods. I currently
                am interested in video game development and computer graphics, so I am also learning Unreal Engine 5 in my free time.
